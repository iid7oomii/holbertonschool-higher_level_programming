# Python - Classes

A collection of object-oriented programming exercises and examples for the "Higher Level Programming" Holberton School track. This folder groups practice problems that illustrate Python classes, objects, and related concepts.

Problem this project solves

- Provides small, self-contained exercises that help learners practice and verify understanding of Python classes and object-oriented design.

Main features

- Organized exercises by topic (OOP / classes)
- Individual Python scripts that demonstrate or test class behavior
- Meant to be used as learning material and practice problems

Tech stack

- Python 3 (standard library)
- SQL (separate directories contain SQL exercises)

Repository structure (relevant folders)

- 0-square_matrix_simple.py (example script at repository root)
- SQL_introduction/
- SQL_more_queries/
- python-abc/
- python-classes/  # this folder

Project structure explanation

Each top-level folder groups exercises around a particular Python topic (for example, "python-classes" contains class- and OOP-related exercises). Files are individual exercises or example scripts that can be executed independently.

Setup and installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/iid7oomii/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming.git

2. Enter the project directory:

   cd holbertonschool-higher_level_programming

3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed (Python 3.8+ recommended):

   python3 --version

How to run the project

- Run individual Python exercises directly with Python 3. For example, to run the example script at the repository root:

  python3 0-square_matrix_simple.py

- Exercises inside folders can be run the same way; change into a directory or reference the file path.

Configuration or environment variables

- This repository does not require any configuration files or environment variables to run the example scripts. If an exercise requires additional setup, it will be noted in that exercise's file or folder.

Example usage

- Execute a script from the repository root:

  python3 0-square_matrix_simple.py

- Run a class exercise inside the python-classes folder (replace <exercise>.py with an actual filename if present):

  python3 python-classes/<exercise>.py

Notes and limitations

- This folder is part of a larger collection of exercises. Not every topic or helper script is centralized here — check the relevant top-level folders for exercises in other areas (SQL, data structures, exceptions, etc.).
- The README describes the educational contents and how to run them; individual exercises may contain their own instructions or dependencies.
